# 2024/08/15 - Buttondown

Date: August 15, 2024
Description: On August 15, 2024, significant time was spent configuring a personal website's newsletter using Buttondown, which offers a strong UX for mailing lists. Despite the effort, there was a realization that content quality is more important than the mailing list itself. Progress was noted in a project called Light, focusing on multiple chains, and a crypto-related development was discussed regarding rollups and blob fee spikes. The day's reading emphasized the importance of maintaining hope and momentum, while a video highlighted the unseen contributions of past creators to everyday life.

### Journal Configuration

I spent a good chunk of my [day](https://github.com/shunkakinoki/shunkakinoki.com/commits/main/?since=2024-08-15&until=2024-08-16) configuring this personal website‚Äôs configuration (specifically CMS ‚Üí Newsletter combo). The email provider I used was [https://buttondown.com/](https://buttondown.com/) which is run by [Justin Duke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-duke-4438a171/). The docs are really well [built](https://docs.buttondown.com/introduction), as well as the [API reference](https://docs.buttondown.com/introduction) is realllllly good. 

Buttondown is run as an indie business (likely have raised no capital), but solves a key problem that is a Good UX Mailing List API. Probably is doing some good numbers by now (ARR in several millions ?!?), makes you realize the power of compounding but also just sticking to one thing for a sustained period of time. It‚Äôs beautiful to see someone that‚Äôs at it for years - especially knowing how hard it is, as most projects in crypto I know have either pivoted, died down, or is non-functional.

I spent probably the last 8 hours trying to configure the mailing list (that is fully automated w/ server actions + more) but ultimately came to realize that no one is going to ever use this (just make the content good and refreshable I guess. But at least the website is fully complete and up-to-date.

## Light Progress

For Light, we‚Äôre committed to sticking to one thing only - using multiple chains as it is one. We have three (1, 2, 3) upcoming releases to compound and realize on this vision. 

- [ ]  Finish the new implementation of the landing page w/ designer
- [ ]  Work on the DAG on frontend, backend + node (transcends all typescript, rust + solidity lol)

### Crypto Progress of the day

This is really cool - drives a fair economic pricing market function for rollups to be resistant from blob fee spikes. I wonder how they function in the implementation complexity for going back and forth between calldata and blobs.

### Reading of the day

[Founders and Momentum](https://multitudes.weisser.io/p/founders-and-momentum)

I need to regain momentum = hope. Even though hope is shit, probably it‚Äôs very *telling* whether one has hope or not from a third person view. If you know someone that has managed to keep hopes (momentum), plz [DM](https://shunkakinoki.com/discord) me.

### Video of the day

So much of what we consider to be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù in our lives is powered by things that someone that we will never know has created in the past (not to mention that someone has a family, parents, and *bloodline* of his own, which is crazy considering the countless things that is around us)
