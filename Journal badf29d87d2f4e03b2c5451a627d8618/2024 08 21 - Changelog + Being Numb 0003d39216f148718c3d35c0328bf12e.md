### Social Help üôè

I want to tweet [more](https://typefully.com/shunkakinoki/stats). I have finally realized that optimizing some [certain UI components](https://github.com/LightDotSo/LightDotSo/pull/2262) just is won‚Äôt cut it. I want to get the product out there and be more annoying. Want to target 10+ tweets per day constantly. However, I am lacking someone to act as an inspiration, other than [@rauchg](https://x.com/rauchg) at this moment. If you know anyone that I should larp/get inspirations from for tweeting constantly, please [DDM](https://shunkakinoki.com/discord)/[TGDM](https://shunkakinoki.com/telegram) me. 

### v0 Launch & AI thoughts

Vercel [launched](https://x.com/v0/status/1826020673908535325) the new version of v0 today - it completely revamped the UI/UX. Feels more of like a traditional ChatGPT like interface, but w/ real-time editor controls. If all of the interface/frontend converges to the one w/ the better integrated interface, will the best frontend win?
