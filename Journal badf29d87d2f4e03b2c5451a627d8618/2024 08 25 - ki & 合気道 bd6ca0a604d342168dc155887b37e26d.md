# 2024/08/25 - ki & 合気道

Date: August 25, 2024
Description: Updates include a focus on shipping daily features, UI separation for future component updates, and a postponed launch due to readiness issues and the desire for perfect demo interactions. A private Aikido lesson highlighted the importance of "ki," the connection between physical and emotional behavior, and the distinction between strength and power. The author aims to deliver useful tools for crypto interactions in the upcoming launch.

## Light Progress

**Changelog Updates**

A few of you may note that I’m posting updates here on [https://warpcast.com/~/channel/changelog](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/changelog) and [https://warpcast.com/~/channel/the-arena](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/the-arena) but want to get this back to track. The aim is to ship one daily feature every day.

**Separation of UI**

I’ve updated the UI/sections here for [https://storybook.light.so/](https://storybook.light.so/) here:

[Light](https://storybook.light.so)

This will be used as the base building block for future component updates, like embedded SDKs to widgets, to more. This [PR](https://github.com/LightDotSo/LightDotSo/pull/2270) is one of the migrations that needed to be done in order to make this possible.

> As a sidenote, I’m trying to port my personal website to Light’s UI

**Launch Postpone**

I’ve decided to postpone the upcoming launch for the below reasons:

- The core tech/demonstration isn’t quite ready, need more time 🙇‍♂️
- Build relations + interact w/ related parties to ship w/ “launch partners” 🙏
- Want to get the demo interactions “perfect” so that it works from day0 🙌

Next week will be focused on the above only for getting towards this.

### Private Notes: 合気道 “Aikido”

I had a private lesson w/ [Mona](https://x.com/littlemonastar) and her father today, doing 合気道 which is a form of Japanese martial arts form. It was really good - here are the main summary points of my learnings.

1. Power comes from “ki” or spirit going through your body, and the fact that the toe is touching the ground is one of the “cues” that you’re going the right way
2. How you behave physically will definitely lead to how you behave emotionally. Thus, it’s important to have the right physical stance not to overly react to the outside environments.
3. “Strength” and “Power” are totally different concepts altogether, like as the strongest man that can do a dumbbell curl is not the one w/ the most power. You need the right mechanics to tame power. 

### Thank you 🫶

Thank you to [Naojin-san](https://discord.com/users/742215516420309072) for such kind words on Light Discord: [https://discord.gg/LightDotSo](https://t.co/yJBzeY4eGm)

I hope to deliver for the upcoming launch, through actual useful tools that shape how most of people will interact with crypto in the near future, and that is through one-click interactions, gasless + chain abstracted experiences.
