Date: August 14, 2024
Description: The journal entry from August 14, 2024, reflects on personal challenges and the author's commitment to documenting their journey while working on the Light project. Key updates include progress on the initial DAG implementation for cross-chain transactions, plans for the next day involving landing page updates and team communications, and reflections on a video by Eric Schmidt about AI. The author also praises Notion as a superior CMS compared to others, highlighting its recent features.

This is my first journal entry so *HERE WE GO*.
(h/t Inspired by mona, <redacted>, <sudoRedacted> to begin, thank you for being my friends and caring for me.)

I will try to journal my thoughts through out the day (but not overdo it) as I share and document my learnings throughout [Light](https://light.so), which is the product/company I’m working on. Expect more todos or strategy like learnings, and as an [open-source maxi](https://oss.capital/), this journal as well, is [open source](https://github.com/shunkakinoki/shunkakinoki.com).

However, I know if this [dude](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1823593475205685588) were me, he would be able to power through this entire situation and flip it entirely on its head. So, which leads me to the conclusion that I have to be better (and not get ridiculed for running in 0.7km increments.)

# Light Progress

### DAG Implementation

I managed to put together something [here](https://github.com/LightDotSo/LightDotSo/pull/2242) for the initial DAG implementation of the [Light Layer](https://paper.light.so/features/light-layer). This is the the core feature of our protocol, since users will programmatically be able to define arbitrary cross-chain transactions. I should probably write this in a separate [blog](https://light.so/blog), but basically what it does is the below:

1. Create a DAG of transactions (2 or more)
2. Specify conditions such as fallbacks, on-chain calls
3. Execute accordingly tailoring to the user’s preferences

Transaction graphs enable one click transactions w/ fallback and conditionals.

# Tomorrow

- [ ]  Finish the new implementation of the landing page w/ designer
- [ ]  Work on the DAG on frontend, backend + node (transcends all typescript, rust + solidity lol)

### Video of the day

[Stanford ECON295/CS323 I 2024 I The Age of AI, Eric Schmidt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxDM8io4lUA)

Have yet to watch the whole thing, but the Eric Schmidt talk seems really good, for example like the excerpt [this](https://x.com/alexkehr/status/1823480786349383879). I’m such in a distant place from making this work - world players giving their best year of lives to a common cause - but scenes like [this](https://x.com/leeerob/status/1823170914265207004) make me feel like [Energy is contagious](../Checklist%20ccf0648ddaab42a38644f209e6cd641f/Energy%20is%20contagious%201aa58b0642d74c77b5e0eec9db6466fd.md), and can potentially come together online through open source (even as a team)

### Github PR of the day

[https://github.com/shunkakinoki/shunkakinoki.com/pull/355](https://github.com/shunkakinoki/shunkakinoki.com/pull/355)

Have to say, but Notion feels extremely *OP* as a CMS, compared to others [[1](https://obsidian.md/)], especially w/ the launch of Notion Charts [[1](https://x.com/i/trending/1823545466791059762)], [[2](https://www.notion.so/product/charts)]. Having my custom [renderer](https://github.com/shunkakinoki/shunkakinoki.com/blob/main/src/components/notion.tsx#L34) is a total MOG compared to having to pay $8 x 2 for some random markdown renderer. (especially if using sane things like sub-par [plugins](https://wordpress.org/plugins/)!)

p.s. Notion’s product landing page is really good, they have like 8 products bundled together as one - really sets the bar for a consumer facing product.
