# 2024/08/27 - Optimism & SDK

Date: August 27, 2024
Description: The document discusses a sense of optimism in the crypto world, highlighting the rarity of genuine enthusiasm. It details progress on a project involving the migration from ethers to alloy, with significant developments in application UI and design discussions. The author expresses excitement about upcoming work and mentions technical readings related to fraud proofing and erasure coding.

## Optimism

Emitting a healthy, [sustainable dose](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%A9%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A1%E3%83%B3%E4%BA%8C%E9%83%8E) of optimism towards the world seems rare (if not in crypto) these days. If not at all, most of ‚Äúoptimism‚Äù seem [forced](https://www.instagram.com/p/C9cbBINypvz/), [*reinforced*](https://www.instagram.com/p/C4kq6G5P3_5/), or either have [bags](https://www.instagram.com/p/C7mTbnJsX2u/) associated with the ones behind. Who is here (I am referring to crypto, in fact) that is here for the sake of what crypto brings to the world?  That seems to be something I am getting lost sight of - but perhaps is something that is most rare in all of [mankind](https://youtu.be/9hMp65SzyTU?si=qNrOcPcwoGUHSo0s&t=107).

## Light Progress

I had a [zone](https://github.com/LightDotSo/LightDotSo/commits/main/?since=2024-08-26&until=2024-08-27) today where I cracked in some 25+ PRs (not a useful metric, but is what ‚Äúcounts‚Äù as shipping.) Here‚Äôs some progress today made:

- Ongoing `ethers` ‚Üí `alloy` migration [here](https://github.com/LightDotSo/LightDotSo/pull/2296)
- Most Application UI is now covered w/ [<Skeleton />](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lightdotso/ui?activeTab=code) w/ `loading.js` [$PPR](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/partial-prerendering)
- Talk w/ [0xOzh](https://twitter.com/0xOzh) for upcoming design implementations

I‚Äôm finally excited about what I am about to be working on, seems like it‚Äôs just $go $go $go moment. But I also at the same time, really need to figure out how to make waves, as I understand this  I also have a sample [`@lightdotso/widget`](https://github.com/LightDotSo/LightDotSo/tree/main/packages/widget) implementation that could be useful for some of our core offerings coming *soon*. The `alloy` transition is a requirement that I‚Äôm working towards because I know that the upcoming rust code needs some low-level EVM utils that I can move and shape schema fast.
