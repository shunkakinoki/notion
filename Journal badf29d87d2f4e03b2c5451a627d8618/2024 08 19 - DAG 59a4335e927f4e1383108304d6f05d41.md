# 2024/08/19 - DAG

Date: August 19, 2024

> I took three days off on the Journal from 8/16~8/18, Iâ€™m back ðŸ™Œ

## Light Progress

- [x]  Revamped the whole architecture of [rendering](https://github.com/LightDotSo/LightDotSo/pull/2249)
- [x]  Working on the DAG implementation of the Light Layer (rust) https://github.com/LightDotSo/LightDotSo/pull/2254
- [x]  Begin team communications for upcoming launch

Iâ€™ve implemented the core part of the Light Layer (WIP) but still figuring out the implementation details for production. Probably will take the whole day tomorrow, but kind of excited as it comes to life ðŸ™Œ

### Tomorrowâ€™s Goals

- [ ]  Implement the DAG synced w/ `contracts` `flow` `python` `rust`
- [ ]  First tx operation conducted w/ the DAG implementation
- [x]  Begin `/changelog` and post the first one on `blog` `changelog` too

### Reading of the day

[Stripe's monorepo developer environment](https://blog.nelhage.com/post/stripe-dev-environment/)

Kind of interesting that a lot of *op* companies like Facebook, Github, OpenAI all revolves around using one centralized monorepo codebase for all of their needsâ€¦ sadly they are all closed source for obvious reasons, but if you need reference for a best-in-class monorepo, check [here](https://github.com/LightDotSo/LightDotSo).

### Github Repo of the Day

This is so fucking cool - of course tweeted [here](https://x.com/rauchg/status/1823038926879076366), local WASM embeddable [postgres-lite](https://pglite.dev/), to the actual schemas + visualizations generated w/ AI, feels like really the future. I wonder how actual [applications](https://v0.dev) will generate revenue, though.

For [context tweet](https://x.com/jdkanani/status/1825329951853191340): but basically this is the Agglayerâ€™s core functionality implemented here: https://github.com/agglayer/lxly-bridge-and-call/blob/b765fb4a98bf947b6fa4a62f41da7b7657d10783/src/BridgeExtension.sol#L115 - synchronous composability may be just `bridge + call` on the destination chain(s).
